		<p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Weir"> John Garvin Weir </a>, also known as &ldquo;Johnny Weir&rdquo;, is an exceptionel figure skater from the United States. He has been on the ice since the age of 12 and has been competing in many (Grand Prix series, Worlds, Olympics, etc.) competitions in both his junior and senior careers. In addition, he is also openly homosexual. </p>
		<p> In former interviews, the star was asked about <i> Yuri!!! On Ice </i>, an anime he watched. He found the characters to be very relatable as he share the same profession as them, as he has been an inspiration for the director of <i> Yuri!!! On Ice</i>. </p>
		<p> &ldquo;I changed coaches and competed in Cup of China and Cup of Russia when I was 23 and trying to reinvigorate my career like Yuri-kun. My junior world championship victory was in Sofia, Bulgaria like Viktor. I even was one of the first skaters who traveled with my own special tissue box starring my favorite cartoon, Cheburashka.&rdquo; </p>
