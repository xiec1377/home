		<h3> &ldquo;History Maker&rdquo; Lyrics </h3>
		<p class="id"> Can you hear my heartbeat？<!--Line breaks used to separate lines for content related reasons.-->
		<br> Tired of feeling never enough
		<br> I close my eyes and tell myself that my dreams will come true
		<br> There&rsquo;ll be no more darkness
		<br> When you believe in yourself you are unstoppable
		<br> Where your destiny lies, dancing on the blades,
		<br> You set my heart on fire
		<br>Don&rsquo;t stop us now, the moment of truth
		<br> We were born to make history
		<br> We&rsquo;ll make it happen, we&rsquo;ll turn it around
		<br> Yes, we were born to make history
		<br> (instrumental) 
		<br> Born to make history
		<br> Bo-bo-born to make history
		<br> Don&rsquo;t stop us now, the moment of truth
		<br> We were born to make history
		<br> We&rsquo;ll make it happen, we&rsquo;ll turn it around
		<br> Yes, we were born to make history
		<br> (instrumental) 
		<br> Can you hear my heartbeat？
		<br> I&rsquo;ve got a feeling it&rsquo;s never too late

		<p> YOI captured the attention of so many, even some who were completely oblivious of &ldquo;anime&rdquo; before. This sensation has inspired fans all over the world, as there are even communities and groups on <a href="http://aminoapps.com/popular/yuri-on-ice-4114513/"> social media </a> dedicated for YOI related content. </p> 
		<h3> <a href="https://tokyogirlsupdate.com/yuri-on-ice-cafe-tv-asahi-201612114013.html"> Café On Ice </a> </h3> 
		<p> As the popularity of this television series sky-rocketed, its production company and Animate Café had developed an iconic attraction in Ikebukuro <!--Ikebukuro, found in Toshima, Tokyo, Japan, is an entertainment district-->, Japan. It opened its doors to the public for the first time on December 1st, but unfortunately, they closed down on December 22nd after the finale of the show (as its purpose was get the audience hyped up for the Grand Prix Final of the show). When the restaurant was of service, customers would have to line up at 9:30 in the morning as it was a first-come-first-serve basis. They would serve adorable YOI themed dishes alongside their colourful themed displays and decorations in the store. </p>

		<h2 id="Johnny_Weir_is_here"> Johnny Weir is here!!! </h2>
		<p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Weir"> John Garvin Weir </a>, also known as &ldquo;Johnny Weir&rdquo;, is an exceptional figure skater from the United States. He has been on the ice since the age of 12 and has been competing in many (Grand Prix series, World&rsquo;s, Olympics, etc.) competitions in both his junior and senior careers. In addition, he is also openly homosexual. </p>
		<p> In former interviews, the star was asked about &ldquo; Yuri!!! On Ice &rdquo;, an anime he had watched. He found the characters to be very relatable as he share the same profession as them, as he has been an inspiration for the director. </p>
		<p> &ldquo;I changed coaches and competed in Cup of China and Cup of Russia when I was 23 and trying to reinvigorate my career like Yuri-kun. My junior world championship victory was in Sofia, Bulgaria like Viktor. I even was one of the first skaters who traveled with my own special tissue box starring my favorite cartoon, Cheburashka.&rdquo; </p>
